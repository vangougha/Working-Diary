## Day 1

I studied for 2 hours and i learned about the basics of ASP.Net Core MVC(HTML rendering, @model etc...).

I also transformed my Steam-Api console app to web app using documents and help of my friends.

## Day 2

I studied for 1 hour and I learned about Model Binding and explanation of Controller and View's.
I created my first project and thats about applying to courses.
And i learned about [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] ,[HttpPost], GET,POST and what [FromForm] stands for.
I also created a simple login page with a form and a button. I used the [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] attribute to prevent cross site scripting.
When I complete course I'll code a To-Do App with a real database for myself.

## Day 3

I started studying at night and I write these at that time. I set up a feedback mechanism, I learned the repository, taghelper and prepared the "Applications" page, which will return the data entered by the user in a way that will be available to other users. Also I added Feedback system, so when you apply you get a reply that says "You're accepted" and I also learned about Model Validation.
